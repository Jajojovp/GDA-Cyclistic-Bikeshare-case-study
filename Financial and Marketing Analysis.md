# Financial and Marketing Analysis
Based on the previous analysis, we can design marketing strategies targeted at different user types. Here, we present some ideas and associated cost and benefit estimates, using statistical data and financial predictive analysis.

## Marketing Strategy for Members
Since members primarily use bicycles during peak hours and weekdays, we can focus on promotions and discounts related to daily use and commuting.

**Annual Membership Discounts:** Offer a discount on annual memberships to attract new members and retain current ones. Let's assume this involves a 10% reduction in the annual membership price. We estimate that this could increase the number of members by 15% throughout the year.

**Referral Program:** Implement a referral program for current members to invite friends and colleagues, offering one month of free membership for each successful referral. Assume that each member will refer an average of 1 person and that the cost of one month of membership is $15.

## Marketing Strategy for Casual Users
Casual users tend to use bicycles on weekends and during afternoon hours. We can focus our strategies on promoting recreational and touristic use of bicycles.

**Weekend Rental Discounts:** Offer a 20% discount on rentals during weekends. Assume that this could increase bicycle usage among casual users by 25% on weekends.

**Tourist Packages:** Collaborate with travel agencies and hotels to offer tourist packages that include bicycle rentals. Assume that this could increase bicycle usage among tourists by 30%.

## Financial Predictive Analysis
Using historical data and estimates of increased user numbers and rentals, we can predict the financial impact of these marketing strategies.

Assume that, before implementing the strategies, the company earns monthly revenues of $100,000 from members and $50,000 from casual users. We apply the estimated increases in user numbers and rentals to these base revenues to predict future revenues.

## Projected Member Revenues:

Increase of 15% in the number of members due to annual membership discounts: $100,000 * 1.15 = $115,000
Referral program cost (assuming 1 referral per member and 1,000 members): 1,000 * $15 = $15,000
Total projected member revenues: $115,000 - $15,000 = $100,000
Projected Casual User Revenues:

Increase of 25% in bicycle usage during weekends due to rental discounts: $50,000 * 1.25 = $62,500
Increase of 30% in bicycle usage among tourists due to tourist packages: $50,000 * 1.30 = $65,000
Total projected casual user revenues: $62,500 + $65,000 - $50,000 = $77,500
Total Projected Revenues (Members and Casual Users): $100,000 (members) + $77,500 (casual) = $177,500

According to our estimates based on predictive analysis, implementing these marketing strategies could result in an increase in total monthly revenues from $150,000 to $177,500, representing a 18.3% increase.

It is important to note that these estimates are based on assumptions and historical data. Monitoring the actual impact of the implemented strategies and adjusting them as needed is crucial. Additionally, other factors such as seasonality and economic conditions should be considered when planning and evaluating marketing strategies.
